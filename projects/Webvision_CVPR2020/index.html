						Welcome to the Webvision Video Track 2020 challenge!
<p></p>
The idea of this challenge is to learn action representations from video subtitles without any human supervision.
<p></p>
The training data is based on the recently released MiningYouTube dataset (working title is 'Weak YouTube', but some people found that this sounds too negative). Please find the homepage here: https://github.com/hildekuehne/Weak_YouTube_dataset
<p></p>
The dataset comprises ~ 20,000 YouTube videos that display explain various egg recipes, namely for fried egg, scrambled egg, pancake, omelet, and egg roll.
<p></p>
For training, we provide the video indexes with the respective subtitles (downloaded in 2017/2018) as well as pre-extracted video clips with tentative labels as described in the paper. For the pre-extracted videos, we further provide pre-computed TSN features (https://github.com/yjxiong/temporal-segment-networks) based on the Kinetics pretrained model.
<p></p>
The training data is available under: https://github.com/hildekuehne/Weak_YouTube_dataset/tree/master/train
<p></p>
The training data is based on subtitles only. It additionally comprises a set of ~5000 videos with class labels and a human annotation if this class label is present in the video, which can be used for training or validation.
<p></p>
The testing data (and validation data for the challenge) is available under: https://github.com/hildekuehne/Weak_YouTube_dataset/tree/master/test
						</p>
					<h3>Two tracks</h3>
			<p>
Note that we will have two tracks for this challenge, one based on the original videos and one based on precomputed features only
			</p>
For the orginal video track, your free to use the full videos or the preextracted video clips. 
For the feature track, you are only allowed to use the preextracted features from the 350k clips. 
In both cases you are allowed to use the yes/no validation data listed in the 'val_yes_no.txt' file (here: https://github.com/hildekuehne/Weak_YouTube_dataset/tree/master/train) for validation and/or training. It's only a few clips per class, so it will not get you all the way, but any new ideas are welcome.
<p></p>			
You can use the orginal subititles or the generated labeles from the baseline. Please do not! download new subtitles as they can change over time.
<p></p>
You can use the test set of the original dataset as validation set. It is not allowed to include the data from the test set as additional training data!
